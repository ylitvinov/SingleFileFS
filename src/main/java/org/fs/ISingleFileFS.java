 * Virtual file system which stores all data (including metadata) inside single "real" file.
 * The primary benefit for this type of file system is that it is centralized and easy to remove.
 * <p/>
 * This is more a prototype, rather that production implementation due to several limitations:
 * <ul>
 * <li>limited number of files you can keep in this file system (all metadata is stored in a single chunk)</li>
 * <li>flushMetadata() operation which is required after adds or deletes</li>
 * <li>no support for directories</li>
 * </ul>
